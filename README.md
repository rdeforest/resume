# Resumé of Robert de Forest

This is my resumé and how I maintain it. It is intended to both document and
demonstrate some of my skills. It does not (yet) demonstrate my System
Engineering as doing so would will take a lot more time. Watch this space for
updates?

# How to use it

If you just want to see my resumé, choose a format:
- [PDF](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/blob/master/public/resume.pdf)
- [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/blob/master/public/resume.html)

Or download them:
- [PDF](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/raw/master/public/resume.pdf)
- [HTML](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/raw/master/public/resume.html)
- [DOCX](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/raw/master/public/resume.docx)

If you want to tinker with it:

- Clone this repo
- Edit config.yaml and the contents of data/ to suit your purpose.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `cake run`

The results are available at http://localhost:3000
