# Resumé of Robert de Forest

This is my resumé and how I maintain it. It is intended to both document and
demonstrate some of my skills. It does not (yet) demonstrate my System
Engineering as doing so would will take a lot more time. Watch this space for
updates?

# How to use it

If you just want to see my resumé, here it is as
- [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/blob/master/public/resume.html).
- [PDF](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume/blob/master/public/resume.pdf).

If you want to tinker with it:

- Clone this repo
- Edit config.yaml and the contents of data/ to suit your purpose.
- Run bin/regen

If you want to serve the result up at http://localhost:3000

- bin/www

# Todo

- Add tests and make them pass
- Integrate better with Express
- Add more formats
  - Markdown
  - LaTeX?
- Improve quality of project (add Cakefile, etc)
- Decide whether to keep data/projects/\*.yaml
- Remove references to "resumé" in code.
  - There's nothing resumé-specific about the code.
- Include all available styles and projects in the "UI".
- Port to AWS?
