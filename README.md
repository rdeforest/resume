# Resume of Robert de Forest

This is my resume and how I maintain it. It is intended to both document and
demonstrate some of my skills. It does not (yet) demonstrate my System
Engineering as doing so would will take a lot more time. Watch this space for
updates?

# How to use it

If you just want to see my resume, follow one of these:

- [HTML]()
- [Markdown]()

If you want to tinker with it:

- Clone this repo
- Edit config.yaml and the contents of data/ to suit your purpose.
- Run bin/regen

If you want to serve the result up under http://localhost

- bin/www

# Todo

- Make regen.coffee use inotify instead of re-hashing the source files
  repeatedly.
- Refactor to integrate better with Express
- Add tests
 - And make them pass
