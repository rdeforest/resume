Hello Expensify,

I saw your posting on LinkedIn and it caught my attention because you asked
candidates to send you an email like this one. It has long been a frustration
of mine that some organizations don't use email as person-to-person
communication anymore, and that employers and candidates use automation to
generate resumes and for resume processors.

Since there's so much to talk about in my 40 years of work and play with
computers, I'm answering your questions briefly with links to the fully
expanded details.

# My responses to your questions

> What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?

The only URL I give out is
[github.com/rdeforest/resume](https://github.com/rdeforest/resume). I have two
vanity domains, `thatsnice.org` and `defore.st`, but I don't host sites behind
them because I don't yet have anything I want to broadcast that isn't already
on [`github`](https://github.com/rdeforest). In the past I did host sites at
these domains, but it was experimental and for my own amusement, rather than
for communicating with an anonymous audience.

Legend has it that I first started programming before I was 10, but my own
memory of teaching myself programming only goes back to 1984. I
[learned](#learned) BASIC, Pascal, C, C++, LambdaMOO, Bash, Perl, Java,
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, DataFax Scripting Language. My first programming
[job](#job) was for my brother-in-law when I was in high-school.

Most of my jobs have been [system-administration](#sysadm-jobs), with a few
odd non-technical jobs, one [phone-support](#phone-support), and one
straight-up [programming](#programming-job). My administrative duties started
when I was in highschool in 1991 and included an ISP, a bank, a startup, that
same ISP, Disney, Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center and finally Amazon.

I've overseen systems running DOS, Windows 3.1 through Win2k4, Novell NetWare,
GNU/Linux (multiple distros), and Solaris. The hosts I was responsible for
have been connected by all the popular hardware: CISCO, F5, Juniper, 3Com,
Livingston (before Lucent acquired them), plus the custom hardware/software
stack Amazon uses. I had [multiple note-worthy
accomplishments](#accomplishments) in all these positions.

Briefly, I want to [level-up](#level-up) my career to positively influence
others in my community (programmers, sysadmins), even outside whatever company
I work for.

> What do I want to do with my life?

[Longest-term](#rest-of-life) I see myself researching, giving presentations
and writing books.

I want my career and recreational time to help shape my relationship with
humanity to better facilitate these kinds of technical and social
improvements. I want to teach and learn, to research, to demonstrate, to try,
fail, try again and succeed. I want my contributions to increase the freedom
and reach of all people everywhere, and to help them do the same for each
other and for future generations.

# Details

At Amazon the levels of leadership from warehouse picker to CEO are delineated
by reach and scope: self, team, organization, vertical, company, community,
country, planet. It's a little more complicated than that, of course, but
that's roughly how I was told to think about it. When I left I was at the team
level. My teammates and I were leading each other in working together more
effectively and helping each other learn. My next promotion would either have
been into management or a kind of Principle Engineer In Training position.



Since the first time I rode a three-speed bike, I've been fascinated with how
machines extend the capabilities of humans. The addition of gears to a bicycle
enables us both to go faster on flat surfaces and to climb steeper surfaces
than we could otherwise. When I was quite young I knew I wanted to do that
kind of thing for humanity: to create tools which extend our reach. Expensify
is a good example of the kind of thing I want to create, and in fact I had
already been thinking about building my own after Intuit sold Mint. Three of
my past jobs scratched elements of this itch incidentally, and I think working
at Expensify would both scratch that itch and put me in direct contact with
more people who have that same kind of optimism about tools. The difference I
see between me and most engineers like me is that I try to balance the
technical aspects with the human ones.

# garbage?
A good tool is like a good manager: it helps when it can and stays out of the
way when it can't. Designing that into tools takes a kind of respect for the
users that I don't see in many organizations. I mention this because your job
posting requesting emails instead of resumes demonstrates the same kind of
thinking that I have.
