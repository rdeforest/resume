Hello Expensify,

I saw your posting on LinkedIn and it caught my attention because you asked candidates to send you an email like this one. It has long been a frustration of mine that some organizations don't use email as person-to-person communication anymore, and that employers and candidates use automation to generate resumes and resume processors. Here are my answers to your questions:

    What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?

The only URL I give out is https://github.com/rdeforest/resume. I have two vanity domains, thatsnice.org and defore.st, but I don't host sites behind them because I don't yet have anything I want to broadcast that isn't already on github. In the past I did host sites at these domains, but it was experimental and for my own amusement, rather than for communicating with an anonymous audience.

    What's your admin/coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?

I think I started programming when I was 10, though my older sister thinks I was younger and I think I was older. I mostly taught myself with occasional help with math from my father, such as when I wanted to simulate gravity. I also wrote two programs for my brother in law which he got paid for and shared some of the proceeds with me. Based on that I can say I've been programming professionally since 1991. In the 33 years since then I've dabbled in dozens of languages and soaked in a handful, listed roughly in the order I encountered them: C and Pascal, BASIC, LambdaMOO, Perl, Bash, Java, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, DataFax Scripting Language.

My administrative duties started when I was in highschool performing backups and installing software for my brother-in-law. Next was as lead tech at an ISP in Santa Cruz, then a bank, a startup, that same ISP, Disney, Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center and finally Amazon. I've admined DOS, Windows, Novell NetWare, GNU/Linux (multiple distros), and Solaris. The hosts I was responsible for have been connected by all the popular hardware: CISCO, F5, Juniper, 3Com, Livingston (before Lucent acquired them), plus the custom hardware/software stack Amazon uses.

_what I actually accomplished goes here_

    What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals? (We’re serious, we want to know! Share what you’re comfortable sharing, but we are a group of ambitious individuals building a community of people who want to achieve success in every aspect of our lives, and we encourage employees to figure out how they can use Expensify to realize their personal goals with the support of the company around them.)

Since the first time I rode a three-speed bike, I've been fascinated with how machines extend the capabilities of humans. The addition of gears to a bicycle enables us both to go faster on flat surfaces and to climb steeper surfaces than we could otherwise. When I was quite young I knew I wanted to do that kind of thing for humanity: to create tools which extend our reach. Expensify is a good example of the kind of thing I want to create, and in fact I had already been thinking about building my own after Intuit sold Mint. Three of my past jobs scratched elements of this itch incidentally, and I think working at Expensify would both scratch that itch and put me in direct contact with more people who have that same kind of optimism about tools. The difference I see between me and most engineers like me is that I try to balance the technical aspects with the human ones.

    What do I want to do with my life?

I want to shape my career and recreational time to help shape my relationship with humanity to better facilitate these kinds of technical and social improvements. I want to teach and learn, to research, to demonstrate, to try, fail, try again and succeed. I want my contributions to increase the freedom and reach of all people everywhere, and to help them do the same for each other.

How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.



A good tool is like a good manager: it helps when it can and stays out of the way when it can't. Designing that into tools takes a kind of respect for the users that I don't see in many organizations. I mention this because your job posting requesting emails instead of resumes demonstrates the same kind of thinking that I have.
